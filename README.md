Repository for Webdev course project - CheckIn

"Find the best places to eat, drink, shop, or visit around you"
CheckedIn is a platform for users to search for interesting places to visit nearby based on their location. It is a social media for your outings! Users can check in at places. They can also rate or review these places or invite their friends to join them. Place owners and managers can maintain a profile for their place and interact with their customers.

The platform retrieves the user location and filters results based on Foursquare API and Facebook. This project was part of CS5610 Web Development course. I intend to keep working on it and building upon it.
