Repository for my project - CheckedIn

**"Find the best places to eat, drink, shop, or visit around you"**  
CheckedIn is a platform for users to search for interesting places to visit nearby based on their location. It is a social media for your outings! Users can check in at places. They can also rate or review these places or invite their friends to join them. Place owners and managers can maintain a profile for their place and interact with their customers.

The platform retrieves the user location and filters results from the Foursquare API and is powered by the MEAN stack. I intend to keep working on it and building upon it. I am currently working on an android application for it.
